# Sundai City Organizer QuickStart Guide

## What is Sundai
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai is about co-creating in teams to turn ideas into shipped products within 12 hours. 

Sundai is born out of MIT and Harvard.

## Hack Day Structure & Process

### Timeline (12-Hour Format):
**Morning (10am-12pm):**
- Newcomer onboarding (short presentation of Sundai Mission & Values, commitment requirements & flow of the day) 
- Idea pitch session (focus on user need & market validation)
- Democratic voting on ideas (impact × feasibility × user need)
- Team formation (minimum 3 people per team)

**Afternoon (12pm-6pm):**
- Core building time - collaborative dev and vibe code
- Lunch coordination (MC to organize or delegate food)
- Optional "Sunday runs" and social breaks ("frolic" time)

**Evening (6pm-10pm):**

- **Deploy live application (6-7pm)**: _'get off the localhost'_

- **Pre-Launch Checklist (7-8pm)**:
  - Open source code on GitHub
  - Create project page on sundai.club
  - Write blog/vlog documentation
  - Post on social media (minimum LinkedIn)
  
- **Launch (8-9pm)** - live user testing, not pitch presentations. Next - team shares with community about which new tools they tried and what worked / didnt work. 

- **Wrap-up (9pm-10pm):** Cleanup & organize space (_everyone_ participates)

## Sundai Principles

### 1.  Build
The purpose of Sundai is to get together and build things. Every Sunday.

### 2. Ship
Try to make your sundai project small, so that you can ship it into users' hands by the END OF THE DAY. This means - build a simple webapp demo that works and make it available on the internet. Do not leave projects unfinished on sunday. Go for less, to do more.

### 3. Frolic
Sundai is a space and time to co-create, explore, rest, enjoy and spend time together with brilliant, open-minded and kind people. It is also a time to have fun ('frolic'). A place to take your mind away from structured work, and to enjoy your day off.

Frolic. Have fun. e.g. go for a run in the middle of a hack day, play a short volleyball match, do a music jam. 

### 4. Share Openly
We open source each hack and post our progress each Sunday on www.sundai.club/projects. We demo our hacks wherever we go and teach workshops on what we learn. 

### 5. Build in Teams
Sundai is a team sport. We encourage each hacker to constantly meet and form new teams and build things TOGETHER. Our diverse skills and backgrounds is what makes our hacks interesting. No solo.

### 6. Help, Clean & Organize
Sundai is a community run by volunteers. The leader of the day (MC) is not paid. Every participant is expected to help clean & organize the room at the end of the day. Every regular hacker is expected to stand up and lead a hack one day. You are the leader of Sundai. It is a hacker group run by hackers for hackers.

## Community Management

### Hacker Levels:
- **Newcomer**: First 4 hacks, focus on learning and integration
- **Hacker**: Regular participants, contribute to community decisions  
- **Core Hacker**: Lead teams, MC events, vote on technical direction

### Promotion:
- **Newcomer → Hacker**: 4 full hack days completed
- **Hacker → Core Hacker**: 3x launch lead + 1x MC + significant community contribution

### Weekly Operations:
Weekly hacker meetings are for community management (separate from hack days). E.g. Tue evenings for 30-60mins. 
- **Choose MC for the week** - rotated among hackers
- **Create Partiful/Luma** for next Sunday and to invite previous attendees
- **Distribute Invites**  to the hack amongst other city meetups and tech groups 
- **Accept 20% newcomers** each session to maintain community continuity. Focus on coders and avoid 'business/MBA only' candidates. 
- **Verify Projects page** - are all prev projects posted on sundai.club/projects (if not done 7-8pm during a hack)?
- **Post on LinkdedIn** about previous hack, link to projects on sundai.club/projects and tag people involved 
- **Plan Future Themes** - plan many hacks in advance. Bring an interesting theme / company / framework
- **Get Sponsors** - for food or venues. Make sure you explain that Sundai is a 'hack' (cooperation + shipping) and not a 'hackathon' (competition + pitching)

## Key Differences from Traditional Tech Meetups

**Not Demo Days**: We don't showcase personal pre-built work - we build together from scratch  
**Not Networking Events**: Our focus is on creating and shipping something new each sunday, not just making new connections. This is not a recruitment event.   
**Not Hangout Space**: Everyone must come to ship something each sunday and contribute to a team, not just 'hangout & vibe'.   
**Not Educational Workshops**: Learning happens through doing, not presentations    
**Not Individual**: Everything is team-based with minimum 3-person teams  
**Not Optional**: Shipping requirements and full-day commitment are non-negotiable  

**We Are**: A movement of builders who ship AI applications together, creating both technology and lasting community bonds through the shared collaborative creation.

*"A world where hacking with AI tools is the new literacy" - Sundai Vision*  

**Remember**: Sundai is about transforming Sunday from a day of rest into a day of collaborative creation. We measure success not in demos or presentations, but in shipped applications, user engagement, and the startups that emerge from our weekly building sessions.
