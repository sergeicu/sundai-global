# Sundai City Organizer QuickStart Guide

## Core Purpose
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai is about **collaborative creation** - turning ideas into shipped products within 12 hours.

## Sundai Cultural Principles

### 1. Build
Every gathering is about creating something new from scratch. No individual pre-work presentations.

### 2. Ship
Projects must be deployed and accessible by end of day. Build small to ship fast. No unfinished projects.

### 3. Frolic  
Balance intense building with fun, rest, and social connection. Encourage breaks, runs, and community bonding.

### 4. Share Openly
Everything is open source immediately. All work acknowledges Sundai and team members prominently.

### 5. Build in Teams
Minimum 3-person teams. No solo projects. Leverage diverse skills and backgrounds collaboratively.

### 6. Help, Clean & Organize
Community-run by volunteers. Everyone contributes to logistics, cleanup, and eventual MC leadership.

## Key Differences from Traditional Tech Meetups

**Not Demo Days**: We don't showcase pre-built work - we build together from scratch
**Not Networking Events**: While community is central, the focus is collaborative creation
**Not Educational Workshops**: Learning happens through doing, not presentations  
**Not Individual**: Everything is team-based with minimum 3-person teams
**Not Optional**: Shipping requirements and full-day commitment are non-negotiable

**We Are**: A movement of builders who ship AI applications together, creating both technology and lasting community bonds through the shared intensity of collaborative creation.

*"A world where hacking with AI tools is the new literacy" - Sundai Vision*

**Remember**: Sundai is about transforming Sunday from a day of rest into a day of collaborative creation. We measure success not in demos or presentations, but in shipped applications, user engagement, and the startups that emerge from our weekly building sessions.
