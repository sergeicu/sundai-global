# Sundai City Organizer QuickStart Guide

## What is Sundai
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai is about co-creating in teams to turn ideas into shipped products within 12 hours. 

Sundai is born out of MIT and Harvard.

## Key Responsibilities of City Organizers

1. **Secure consistent venues** with power, wifi, and collaborative workspace
2. **Curate active builders** - screen for commitment to full-day participation  
3. **Delegate MC role weekly** and support MC leadership development 
4. **Community growth**: Onboard newcomers (recommend max 20% newcomers per event)
5. **Post-hack follow-up**: Ensure all teams meet shipping requirements on sundai.club/projects (very important)

## How to Lead a Hack 

**Role: Master of Ceremonies (MC)**: MCs lead the day of the hack.

MCs are chosen and rotated weekly. 

MCs (often with a co-MC) share the following responsibilities:

1. **Food** - delegate how participants will get food. Get breakfast and lunch (only when sponsored).
2. **Newcomers** - onboard newcomers and answer their questions
3. **Brainstorm** - lead the brainstorm or find someone to be the 'Brainstorm' lead.
4. **Showcase** - lead the evening showcase or find someone to be the 'Showcase' lead.

## Communication

### Discord
Discord is the main place for the entire community to discuss projects, share news, go into calls and connect globally.  
Global hacks have their own dedicated forums, e.g. Sundai-Berlin, where projects can be posted.    
Sundai City Organizers will get priviliged management rights on Discord. 

### Social Media
We use Sundai's LinkedIn and X the most. You can setup your own if you like with sundai in the name. 

### Website
We will help setup subpages to individual projects under sundai.club or sundai.foundation. 

E.g. paris.sundai.club, research.sundai.club.

### Weekly meetings
Usually held once per week once the club matures. Offer a chance for all active hackers of the community to give feedback and discuss outside the usual sundai hack day. Sundai Hack is typically reserved for hacking NOT management of the club. Management of sundai on a sunday is highly discouraged, inc. for City Organizer. The spirit of Sundai is to build on a sunday.


## Venue Requirements

### Essential Features:
- **Availability on Sunday** it's in the name, it must be a Sunday
- **Collaborative workspace** with tables for 3-6 person teams
- **Reliable high-speed internet** for development and deployment
- **Power access** for all participants' devices
- **(optional) Presentation area** for evening showcases. Also works - share a zoom link and sit in a circle.

### Capacity Planning & Growth:
- We recommend that you start small with a group of friends. 
- Grow slowly. Accept 20-30% newcomers each session to maintain continuity.
- Target 10-30 participants per session. 
- Gently but firmly kick out people that don't come to hack (e.g. those that just talk, or those that come just to recruit, or have bad vibes, etc)
- Generally avoid 'business/MBA only' attendees that **do not try to code with Cursor/Claude Code/etc at a hack, or contribute meaningfully (e.g. build Miro/Figma wireframes)**. They will pitch big infeasible ideas and make team work difficult. Knowing the limit of what is possible to do in a day requires knowledge of tools.
- Avoid large impersonal 'hackathon' style gatherings with 30+ people. That's not Sundai spirit. If you want to organize a giant 'Hackathon' with prizes and judges, then do it outside of Sundai. Sundai is about hacks, community, cooperation, learning, sharing. 

## Promotional Strategies

### Target Audience:
- **Full-stack developers** interested in AI tools
- **Startup founders** and technical co-founders
- **AI researchers** wanting to build applications
- **Product managers** with technical backgrounds
- **Designers** 

### Outreach Channels:
- **Direct recruitment** from local tech communities
- **University partnerships** (especially CS/AI programs)
- **Startup ecosystem** connections and accelerator networks
- **AI/ML meetup** cross-promotion with complementary events
- **Social media** showcasing shipped projects and team success stories

## Retreats:

Retreats are the fundamental part of club participation. Retreats are scheduled every ~8 weeks for alignment, team bonding, and planning. They include a lot of frolic, and some planning. They usually take place out of the city, ideally in nature. A retreat ends the 'sprint' (a set of ~7 hacks, followed by a retreat). Retreats are the most magical experiences of sundai.

In retreats the following happens:
- Definition of strategic directions for the club for next sprint (~7weeks)
- Discussion to new proposed 'community initiatives'
- Discussion of key strategic partnerships
- Promotion in hacker rank
- Review of growth and goals
  - How many new hackers
  - How many core hackers and hackers in residence
  - How many new projects
  - How many returning projects (3+ hacks)
  - How many new startups

- **Location**: Outside city, preferably in nature
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning, team bonding, rank promotions
- **Activities**: Goal review, partnership discussions, community initiative planning
- **Metrics Review**: New hackers, projects shipped, startups launched, returning projects

## Partnership Guidelines

### Alignment Requirements:
- Partners must embrace Sundai principles (build, ship, frolic, share, team, community - see 'Constitution')
- Clear Sundai attribution in all collaborative materials
- Mutual benefit for hacker community growth and resources

### Potential Partners:
- **Tech companies** providing APIs, credits, or tools
- **Universities** for venue access and student recruitment
- **Accelerators/VCs** for startup transition support
- **Other hacker communities** for cross-pollination events

## Success 

### Metrics to Track:
- **Participation**: New hackers, retention rates, promotion pipeline
- **Output**: Projects shipped per session, user engagement, GitHub stars
- **Community Growth**: Startup formation, paper publications, ongoing projects
- **Network Effects**: Partnerships formed, cross-city collaboration
