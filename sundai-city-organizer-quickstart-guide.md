# Sundai City Organizer QuickStart Guide

## Core Purpose
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai is about **collaborative creation** - turning ideas into shipped products within 12 hours.

## Key Responsibilities of City Organizers

### Essential Duties
1. **Secure consistent venues** with power, wifi, and collaborative workspace
2. **Curate active builders** - screen for commitment to full-day participation  
3. **Delegate MC role weekly** and support MC leadership development
4. **Community growth**: Onboard newcomers (max 20% of total participants)

## Attendee Screening Criteria 

Each Attendee Must Be Able To "Actively Build": 
- **Code** - ability to code or a commitment to (with AI tools ofc)

- **Ship** - focus on deploying a user-facing application by end of the day 

### Commitment Requirements:

- **Community contribution** - help with setup/cleanup. We are all volunteers. Everyone helps to run the event. 
- **Attribution** - post projects on sundai.club/projects and clearly display 'Built at Sundai' on website or demos (e.g. footer, etc) 

## Hack Day Structure & Process

### Timeline (12-Hour Format):
**Morning (10am-12pm):**
- Newcomer onboarding (short presentation of Sundai Mission & Values, commitment requirements & flow of the day) 
- Idea pitch session (focus on user need & market validation)
- Democratic voting on ideas (impact × feasibility × user need)
- Team formation (minimum 3 people per team)

**Afternoon (12pm-6pm):**
- Core building time - collaborative dev and vibe code
- Lunch coordination (MC to organize or delegate food)
- Optional "Sunday runs" and social breaks ("frolic" time)

**Evening (6pm-10pm):**

- **Launch prep (7-8pm)**:
  - Open source code on GitHub
  - Create project page on sundai.club
  - Write blog/vlog documentation
  - Post on social media (minimum LinkedIn)
  - And of course - deploy working application
 
- **Launch (8-9pm)** - live user testing, not pitch presentations. After - team members talk about which new tools they tried and worked / didnt. Share lessons with others. 

**Wrap-up (9pm-10pm):**
- Cleanup & organize space (everyone participates)

## Sundai Cultural Principles

### 1. Build
Every gathering is about creating something new from scratch. No individual pre-work presentations.

### 2. Ship
Projects must be deployed and accessible by end of day. Build small to ship fast. No unfinished projects.

### 3. Frolic  
Balance intense building with fun, rest, and social connection. Encourage breaks, runs, and community bonding.

### 4. Share Openly
Everything is open source immediately. All work acknowledges Sundai and team members prominently.

### 5. Build in Teams
Minimum 3-person teams. No solo projects. Leverage diverse skills and backgrounds collaboratively.

### 6. Help, Clean & Organize
Community-run by volunteers. Everyone contributes to logistics, cleanup, and eventual MC leadership.

- **Core Hacker**: Lead teams, MC events, vote on technical direction

### Promotion Requirements:

## Key Differences from Traditional Tech Meetups

**Not Demo Days**: We don't showcase pre-built work - we build together from scratch
**Not Networking Events**: While community is central, the focus is collaborative creation
**Not Educational Workshops**: Learning happens through doing, not presentations  
**Not Individual**: Everything is team-based with minimum 3-person teams
**Not Optional**: Shipping requirements and full-day commitment are non-negotiable

**We Are**: A movement of builders who ship AI applications together, creating both technology and lasting community bonds through the shared intensity of collaborative creation.

*"A world where hacking with AI tools is the new literacy" - Sundai Vision*

**Remember**: Sundai is about transforming Sunday from a day of rest into a day of collaborative creation. We measure success not in demos or presentations, but in shipped applications, user engagement, and the startups that emerge from our weekly building sessions.
