# Sundai City Organizer QuickStart Guide

## What is Sundai
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai is about co-creating in teams to turn ideas into shipped products within 12 hours. 

Sundai is born out of MIT and Harvard.

## Key Responsibilities of City Organizers

### City Organizer Duties
1. **Secure consistent venues** with power, wifi, and collaborative workspace
2. **Curate active builders** - screen for commitment to full-day participation  
3. **Delegate MC role weekly** and support MC leadership development
4. **Community growth**: Onboard newcomers (max 20% of total participants)
5. **Post-hack follow-up**: Ensure all teams meet shipping requirements

### MC Duties (Rotated Weekly)
- **Lead the hack day** as Master of Ceremonies (MC) throughout 12-hour session
- **Coordinate food & logistics** throughout the day
- **Facilitate team formation** and project selection processes
- **Facilitate brainstorm and launch** for the start and end of the day respectively
## Venue Requirements

### Essential Features:
- **~12-hour availability** (Sundays)
- **Collaborative workspace** with tables for 3-6 person teams
- **Reliable high-speed internet** for development and deployment
- **Power access** for all participants' devices
- **(optional) Presentation area** for evening showcases. Also works - share a zoom link and sit in a circle.

### Capacity Planning & Growth:
- Always start small with a group of friends. A group of 6 friends is better than a group of 30 strangers.
- Grow slowly. Accept 20-30% newcomers each session to maintain continuity.
- Target 10-30 participants per session max. 
- Gently but firmly kick out people that don't come to hack (e.g. those that just talk, or those that come just to recruit, etc)
- Generally avoid 'business/MBA only' attendees that **do not try to code with Cursor/Claude Code/etc at a hack, or contribute meaningfully (e.g. build Miro/Figma wireframes)**. They will pitch big infeasible ideas and make team work difficult. Knowing the limit of what is possible to do in a day requires knowledge of tools.
- Avoid large impersonal 'hackathon' style gatherings 

## Promotional Strategies

### Target Audience:
- **Full-stack developers** interested in AI tools
- **Startup founders** and technical co-founders
- **AI researchers** wanting to build applications
- **Product managers** with technical backgrounds
- **Designers** 

### Outreach Channels:
- **Direct recruitment** from local tech communities
- **University partnerships** (especially CS/AI programs)
- **Startup ecosystem** connections and accelerator networks
- **AI/ML meetup** cross-promotion with complementary events
- **Social media** showcasing shipped projects and team success stories

## Retreat & Strategic Planning

### Quarterly Retreats (Every ~8 weeks):
- **Location**: Outside city, preferably in nature
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning, team bonding, rank promotions
- **Activities**: Goal review, partnership discussions, community initiative planning
- **Metrics Review**: New hackers, projects shipped, startups launched, returning projects

### Success Metrics to Track:
- **Participation**: New hackers, retention rates, promotion pipeline
- **Output**: Projects shipped per session, user engagement, GitHub stars
- **Community Growth**: Startup formation, paper publications, ongoing projects
- **Network Effects**: Partnerships formed, cross-city collaboration

## Partnership Guidelines

### Alignment Requirements:
- Partners must embrace Sundai principles (build, ship, frolic, share, team, community)
- Clear Sundai attribution in all collaborative materials
- Mutual benefit for hacker community growth and resources

### Potential Partners:
- **Tech companies** providing APIs, credits, or tools
- **Universities** for venue access and student recruitment
- **Accelerators/VCs** for startup transition support
- **Other hacker communities** for cross-pollination events

*"A world where hacking with AI tools is the new literacy" - Sundai Vision*  

**Remember**: Sundai is about transforming Sunday from a day of rest into a day of collaborative creation. We measure success not in demos or presentations, but in shipped applications, user engagement, and the startups that emerge from our weekly building sessions.
