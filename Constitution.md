# Sundai Club Constitution

## Article I: Mission & Vision

### What is Sundai:
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai is about using state of the art AI tools and co-creating in teams to turn ideas into shipped products within 12 hours. 
Sundai is born out of MIT and Harvard.

### Our Mission
Push the envelope of what is possible to do with AI in a day.

1. **Grow the Best Hackers**  
   learn to build fast with AI
2. **Build things that matter**  
   users / $$$ / github ⭐️
3. **Spread the Hacker Mindset**  
   teach the skills that we learn at MIT and beyond

### Our Vision
*"A world where hacking with AI tools is the new literacy."*

### What is a hacker
Someone who moves fast with little capital and resources to make impact on focused problems. 

```python
def hacker_vs_engineer():
    # hacker/              # engineer/
    → fast                 → meticulous
    → uses structure       → builds structure
    → flexible, prototypes → stable, robust
```

### Why now (short version):
- **10x developer is not a myth, it is you today**

- **Building with AI tools is the new literacy.**

### Why (long version):
**Universal accessibility**: Just as literacy spread from being a rare skill of the elite to a basic expectation for everyone, we envision AI hacking becoming accessible to all people regardless of their background or formal education.

**Fundamental capability**: Reading and writing are considered baseline skills needed to function in society. Our vision is about being able to use AI tools which will become equally essential.

**Cultural shift**: Literacy changed how societies function, enabling new forms of commerce, governance, and social interaction. Similarly, widespread AI hacking capabilities would fundamentally change how problems are solved and how value is created.

**Economic necessity**: Just as being illiterate today severely limits one's economic opportunities, a future where not knowing how to leverage AI tools to build solutions would leave one at a significant disadvantage.

**Democratized creation**: Literacy democratized access to knowledge. AI hacking literacy would democratize the ability to create technology solutions, shifting power from specialized developers to anyone with ideas.

## Article II: Principles

Here are the 6 guiding principles of Sundai Club.

### Build
The purpose of Sundai is to get together and build things. Every Sunday.

### Ship
Try to make your sundai project small, so that you can ship it into users' hands by the END OF THE DAY. This means - build a simple webapp demo that works and make it available on the internet. Do not leave projects unfinished on sunday. Go for less, to do more.

### Frolic
Sundai is a space and time to co-create, explore, rest, enjoy and spend time together with brilliant, open-minded and kind people. It is also a time to have fun ('frolic'). A place to take your mind away from structured work, and to enjoy your day off.

Frolic. Have fun. e.g. go for a run in the middle of a hack day, play a short volleyball match, do a music jam. 

### Share Openly
We open source each hack and post our progress each Sunday on www.sundai.club/projects. We demo our hacks wherever we go and teach workshops on what we learn.

### Build in Teams
Sundai is a team sport. We encourage each hacker to constantly meet and form new teams and build things TOGETHER. Our diverse skills and backgrounds is what makes our hacks interesting. No solo.

### Help, Clean & Organize
Sundai is a community run by volunteers. The leader of the day (MC) is not paid. Every participant is expected to help clean & organize the room at the end of the day. Every regular hacker is expected to stand up and lead a hack one day. You are the leader of Sundai. It is a hacker group run by hackers for hackers.

We copyleft this Burning Man principle:
> *Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through [community] actions.*

## Article III: Who Can Become a Sundai Hacker

1. **Eligibility**: Open to individuals with coding skills or a commitment to learn and ship code with AI tools. Each week the club will accept no more than 20% of total as newcomers to keep consistent effort.

2. **Commitment**: Members must participate fully in Sundai hacks (10 am to 10pm, or whatever is 'a full day hack' on that day). People that leave 'early' are highly discouraged as it breaks the flow of the team work. Don't do half day - come to the full day when you can give it 100%.

3. **Team Work**: Members work on the chosen ideas of the day, not their own individual projects. Sundai is for teams to build new projects, not someone's individual work.

## Article IV: How a Sundai Hack Works

### Process:

- **Pre-hack**: hackers may conduct user interviews for hack ideas. This will be valued more than ideas brought on the fly. hackers may prepare and organize themes for specific hacks.

- **Idea Selection**: Vote on ideas together. We vote based on: impact, technical feasibility, user need. Ideas that can be accomplished in a day proceed to the team formation stage.

- **Team Formation**: A team must be a minimum of 3. We encourage you to meet new people and form new teams each week. 

- **Hacking**: Free-flow. Quick check-in at lunchtime. Every team shouts what they did in last 1-2 hours.

- **Pre-launch prep**: Each team must 
  
  1. post a project on sundai.club page with  a) open source code b) a blog or vlog
  2. make a post on social media (min linkedin)
  5. All webpages, posts or code must clearly acknowledge Sundai and all team members of a hack in a visible manner. Templates or Examples will be provided.

- **Launch**: Hack launch is NOT a pitch. It is a trial. A random member of Sundai audience comes to Sundai.club webpage, opens the link to your app and talks through what they see. All members discuss the project to give feedback. Your team shares your insights about the hack with everyone - e.g. which tech tools you used and what you learned

- **Track**: After launch, each team should track engagement and users on social media or on conduct user interviews.

- **Iterate**: Bring projects back and improve. Our goal is to enable as many startups or impact projects to grow out of sundai. Once a project returns for a 2nd or 3rd hack - it can be made 'closed source'. HOWEVER - 1. all efforts must be acknowledged clearly based on effort put in by all team members. 2. Acknowledge Sundai itself in any work, including hacks and papers in all public materials.

## Article V: How to Lead a Hack (or a Retreat)

### Hacks:

**Role: Master of Ceremonies (MC)**: MCs lead the day of the hack.

MCs are chosen weekly. You can only be promoted to 'Core Hacker' (see Sundai Levels below) if you MC at least one hack.

MCs lead the entire day and have the following responsibilities:

1. **Food** - delegate how participants will get food. Get breakfast and lunch (only when sponsored).
2. **Newcomers** - onboard newcomers and answer their questions
3. **Brainstorm** - lead the brainstorm or find someone to be the 'Brainstorm' lead.
4. **Showcase** - lead the evening showcase or find someone to be the 'Showcase' lead.

### Retreats:

Retreats are the fundamental part of club participation. Retreats are scheduled every ~8 weeks for alignment, team bonding, and planning. They include a lot of frolic, and some planning. They usually take place out of the city, ideally in nature. A retreat ends the 'sprint' (a set of ~7 hacks, followed by a retreat). Retreats are the most magical experiences of sundai.

In retreats the following happens:
- Definition of strategic directions for the club for next sprint (~7weeks)
- Discussion to new proposed 'community initiatives'
- Discussion of key strategic partnerships
- Promotion in hacker rank
- Review of growth and goals
  - How many new hackers
  - How many core hackers and hackers in residence
  - How many new projects
  - How many returning projects (3+ hacks)
  - How many new startups

## Article VI: How to do Partnerships

All initiatives must share Sundai principles (see Article III).

All initiatives or partnerships must clearly display its affiliation with Sundai in publicly shared materials, such as powerpoint presentations or websites.
