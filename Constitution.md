# Sundai Club Constitution

## Article I: Mission & Vision

### What is Sundai:
A global network born out of Harvard & MIT that trains the next generation of AI builders and founders, who come together weekly to build & ship with AI to tackle humanity's hardest challenges. We connect the top universities and tech companies together with top tech talent. We focus heavily on experimenting with state of the art AI tools & papers, and promote the move away from 'vibecoding' to 'agentic coding' era.

Our flagship events are 'Sundai Hacks' - which bring together AI researchers and developers who weekly every single Sunday to rapidly prototype and deploy AI applications in 12-hour intensive sessions. Unlike traditional tech meetups, Sundai focuses on hands-on experience where participants leverage state-of-the-art AI tools, form collaborative teams, and ship functional applications that solve pressing problems by day's end. We promote 'build first' and 'ship into users hands by end of the day' mindset. Our meetups are not hackathons, as we focus on collaborative, community-driven, open-source, real-world problem sets that are deployed as REAL applications or tech tool evaluations, rather than presentations for judges and awards at hackathons. 

### Our Mission
Cultivate a generation of builders & founders who use AI to tackle humanity's hardest challenges 

1. **Train the Best Hackers**  
   harness AI tools to the maximum
2. **Build things that matter**  
   users / $$$ / github ⭐️
3. **Spread the Hacker Mindset**  
   teach the skills that we learn at MIT and beyond. Empower technical talent to rapidly solve focused problems with minimal resources. Teach for global impact. Focus on state of the art AI tools & frameworks. 


### Our Vision
*"A world where hacking with AI tools is the new literacy."*

### What is a hacker
Someone who moves fast with little capital and resources to make impact on focused problems. 

```python
def hacker_vs_engineer():
    # hacker/              # engineer/
    → fast                 → meticulous
    → uses structure       → builds structure
    → flexible, prototypes → stable, robust
```

### Why now (short version):
- **10x developer is not a myth, it is you today**

- **Building with AI tools is the new literacy.**

### Why (long version):
**Universal accessibility**: Just as literacy spread from being a rare skill of the elite to a basic expectation for everyone, we envision AI hacking becoming accessible to all people regardless of their background or formal education.

**Fundamental capability**: Reading and writing are considered baseline skills needed to function in society. Our vision is about being able to use AI tools which will become equally essential.

**Cultural shift**: Literacy changed how societies function, enabling new forms of commerce, governance, and social interaction. Similarly, widespread AI hacking capabilities would fundamentally change how problems are solved and how value is created.

**Economic necessity**: Just as being illiterate today severely limits one's economic opportunities, a future where not knowing how to leverage AI tools to build solutions would leave one at a significant disadvantage.

**Democratized creation**: Literacy democratized access to knowledge. AI hacking literacy would democratize the ability to create technology solutions, shifting power from specialized developers to anyone with ideas.

## Article II: Principles

Here are the 6 guiding principles of Sundai Club.

### Build
The purpose of Sundai is to get together and build things. Every Sunday.

### Ship
Try to make your sundai project small, so that you can ship it into users' hands by the END OF THE DAY. This means - build a simple webapp demo that works and make it available on the internet. Do not leave projects unfinished on sunday. Go for less, to do more.

### Frolic
Sundai is a space and time to co-create, explore, rest, enjoy and spend time together with brilliant, open-minded and kind people. It is also a time to have fun ('frolic'). A place to take your mind away from structured work, and to enjoy your day off.

Frolic. Have fun. e.g. go for a run in the middle of a hack day, play a short volleyball match, do a music jam. 

### Share Openly
We open source each hack and post our progress each Sunday on www.sundai.club/projects. We demo our hacks wherever we go and teach workshops on what we learn.

### Work in Teams
Sundai is a team sport. We encourage each hacker to constantly meet and form new teams and build things TOGETHER. Our diverse skills and backgrounds is what makes our hacks interesting. No solo.

### Help, Clean & Organize
Sundai is a community run by volunteers. The leader of the day (MC) is not paid. Every participant is expected to help clean & organize the room at the end of the day. Every regular hacker is expected to stand up and lead a hack one day. You are the leader of Sundai. It is a hacker group run by hackers for hackers.

We copyleft this Burning Man principle:
> *Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through [community] actions.*

### Shortcuts
Shortcuts is an ingenious move that a hacker makes to build a system that works. In order to build fast - you always need to think in shortcuts.
